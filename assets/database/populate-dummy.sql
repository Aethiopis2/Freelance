Because                <br>
Now in the open,       <br>
Now on the sly         <br>
Nonstop it labors      <br>

Many heard the         <br>

Happily,               <br>
The response from      <br>
The west was           <br>
Tossing it off         <br>

From                   <br>
TPLF''s inception      <br>
To its tyranny         <br>
We were on the ball    <br>
That is why            <br>
We are mourning        <br>
Its demise &           <br>
Catastrophic fall.     <br>
<br>
Before our eyes        <br>
TPLF stands tall       <br>
''cause it saw to      <br>
Our dictates all,       <br>
When we asked it        <br>
A room                  <br>
In Ethiopia''s politics <br>
It used to              <br>
Give us a hall.         <br>
For our satisfaction    <br>
It was on the toes      <br>
It sleeves to roll.     <br>

"TPLF                   <br>
(Dear Meles Zenawi)     <br>

Ignominious defeat      <br>
Forced with their tails <br>
Between their legs      <br>

Valorous march and      <br>

Very well               <br>
TPLF, suffering         <br>
Death knell,            <br>
Is past master          <br>
In terrorism,           <br>
Not in store            <br>
Even in hell,           <br><br>
Seeing its deeds            <br>
That everyone               <br>
Effortlessly                <br>
Could tell.                 <br>

TPLF was out                <br>
In East Africa              <br>
To spell death.             <br>
<br>
It was adverse              <br>
To peace brokers.           <br>
<br>
When TPLF said              <br>

It conducted was            <br>
Hundred % a hit             <br>

Our sides were              <br>
To split                    <br>
But we showed               <br>
A green light               <br>
"Go ahead                   <br>
Do it!"                     <br>
<br>
To Bin laden                <br>
We showed                   <br>
No mercy                    <br>
But around                  <br>
A horseshoe                 <br>

You, peace-seekers &        <br>
Peace keepers,              <br>

Worst terrorist             <br>
Defeated, exposed           <br>
On the retreat.             <br>

To meet our ends            <br>
We use                      <br>
Carrot and stick            <br>
To terrorist                <br>
The former                  <br>
And stick                   <br>
To the latter.              <br>

Defying our interest        <br>
Our arrogance,              <br>
Our image                   <br>
Ethiopia did harm.          <br>
This way Egypt              <br>
Our bargaining chip         <br>
Is slowly but surely        <br>
Getting out of              <br>
Our grip                    <br>
So on Ethiopia              <br>
, our pushover, let us      <br>
Use a sanction whip.        <br>
Ethiopia we have            <br>
To flog, to beat            <br>

Fail that to heed?                  <br>
<br>
In courting trouble                 <br>
TPLF was proactive                  <br>
Reactive were those                 <br>
On the other side                   <br>

Shortfalls from Ethiopia’s side     <br>
And ready to swim against           <br>

Dragged to light and                <br>
Known far and wide!                 <br>

On the stair sashay         <br>
